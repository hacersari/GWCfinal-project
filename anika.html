  Hi! My name is Anika Prabhu. I am a rising junior at North Creek High School in Bothell. I have a great interest in business and see myself as a successful businesswoman in the future. To pursue my future goals, i joined a club in school called FBLA, which stands for Future Business Leaders of America. FBLA is a business competition for young entreprenuers such as myself. Anyway, over the summer I joined a summer immersion program for coding, called Girls Who Code. Here at girls who code, I have a group of loving and supportive girls by my side who look out for me and have shown me nothing but kindness and encouragement. Girls who code is like a second family to me, and I reccomend joining this program to anyone who loves community and learning as much as I do. My hobbies outside of the program and school include, drawing, painting, singing, listning to music, playing with my dog, and binge-watching netflix shows. And thats all I have to say about myself.
