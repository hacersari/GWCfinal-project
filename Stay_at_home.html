    <h3>Cultures and Traditions</h3>
    <p> With food you know there are many different types of cultures and traditions involved. One of my favorite types of food is Italian. Italian food is relatively known for its simplicity with most dishes only consisting of about two to four ingredients.Italian food began to form after the fall of the Roman Empire, when various cities started to separate and form their own traditions. Many different types of bread and pasta were made, and there was a variation in cooking techniques and preparation. Some famous Italian dishes include, pasta, pizza, lasagne, Gelato, and Tiramissu.
